# Lexical-Analyser
Lexical analyser for Assembly language in C programming language by Jintu Kumar Das (jintuisbusy).
Its a very basic assembly analyzer.I didn't handle the duplicate values so if you write any variable 2 times it will show up two times as my code linearly check each token.
# Happy Coding :)
