# Lexical-Analyser
Lexical analyser for Assembly language in C programming language

Its a very basic assembly analyser but you can extend it.You just need to add elements to the array and change the size of the for loop or you can use sizeof() function to calculate the size automatically.
Also i didn't handle the duplicate values so if you write any constant variable 2 times it will show up two times as my code linearly check each token.
